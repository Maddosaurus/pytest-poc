# pytest-poc

This PoC shows how to test a Python 3 module from outside its directory.  
The shim `context.py` has been lent from [The Hitchhiker's Guide To Python](https://docs.python-guide.org/writing/structure/#test-suite), which is a recommended read for everyone.  
There is only one dependency; pytest: `pip install pytest`
